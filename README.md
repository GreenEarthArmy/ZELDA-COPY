# Welcome to the first game I ever made.

It's a simple game, the source files are here.

>src/main folder:
this folder contains all the .java files required to make this work.

>res folder:
This folder contains all the resource files, so if you wonder if you could change the size of the map, yes you can, I'll teach it right away.

>target folder:
it's the folder with the Java bytecode already build and ready to be blended into a jar file. (I used eclipse to make all game, so building from there is ideal!!)

## Guide to customization:

Intro: it all resorts into the resource folder.
> Sprites are divided into square pixels of 16*16 pixels
> respectively the sprites are (mactricially represented)
grass, wall, 4x player walk right, health pack, 3x gun
player damage, grass fx1, 4x player walk left, ammo item, 2x enemy walk, enemy damage,
none, grass fx2, 6x none, 2x gun damage

> The Level editing mechanic is simple:
(each 1 pixel is one placement in map)
(MAKE SURE TO COPY THE COLLORS FROM THE MAP)
Black -> grass(Walkable floor)
White -> walls(non walkable surface)
Green -> grass animations :)
Cyan blue -> Gun
Blue dark -> player starting position (must be only 1 or else error)
Red -> enemies
Yellow -> ammo
Pink -> health pack

> Custom Font
Just add a rtf file with the same name and boom you have new font :D
